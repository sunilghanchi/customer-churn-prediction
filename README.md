# Customer Churn Prediction
"Predict customer churn using data analysis and machine learning to identify potential users at risk of leaving a service, enabling proactive measures to retain them and sustain business growth."


**Customer Churn Prediction Process:**

**1. Data Collection and Exploration:**
Collect historical customer data, including attributes, interactions, and churn labels. Explore the data to understand its structure, identify missing values, and detect outliers.

**2. Data Preprocessing:**
Handle missing values and outliers through imputation or removal. Encode categorical variables for machine learning compatibility. Split the data into features (X) and target (y) sets.

**3. Feature Engineering:**
Create relevant features that can enhance prediction accuracy. This may involve transforming existing variables, generating new metrics, and normalizing data if required.

**4. Model Selection and Training:**
Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc., for regression. Train models using training data and fine-tune hyperparameters.

**5. Model Evaluation:**
Assess model performance using regression metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). Utilize techniques like cross-validation to validate results.

**6. Hyperparameter Tuning:**
Optimize model parameters for better predictions. Employ techniques like GridSearchCV to explore parameter combinations and achieve optimal performance.

**7. Model Deployment (Development Environment):**
Deploy the best-performing model in a simulated production-like environment. Ensure it can accept new customer data and provide churn predictions.

**8. Interpretation and Insights:**
Analyze feature importance to understand factors influencing churn. Extract actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies.

**9. Documentation and Reporting:**
Create a Jupyter Notebook or Python script summarizing the approach, preprocessing steps, model selection, evaluation metrics, and results.

**10. Further Iteration:**
Iterate and refine the process based on new data and changing business requirements. Continuously monitor and improve the model's performance.
